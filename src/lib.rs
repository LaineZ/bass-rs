/// The main entrypoint for this lib.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ## Initialization
///
/// There are using `BassBuilder` struct to build BASS
///
/// The `build()` function will return a Bass object, which should not be dropped as long as you want to use bass.
///
/// ## Playing Audio
///
/// To play audio, you must first make a channel.
/// There are three kinds of channel you can create:
///
/// [`StreamChannel`], [`SampleChannel`], and [`MusicChannel`]. (View these structs for usage and examples).
///
/// Once a channel has been created, you can start playing audio by running .play() on it.
///
/// Each channel is de-ref into a [`Channel`], so see it for more usage
///
/// # Dropping
/// When this object is dropped, it will un-initialize bass (Bass_Free).
///
/// Bass will need to be re-initialized before use, and any channels will have to be remade
